# Cynefin framework

The Cynefin framework  is a conceptual framework used to aid decision-making. Created in 1999 by [[Dave Snowden]] when he worked for IBM Global Services, it has been described as a "sense-making device". Cynefin is a Welsh word for habitat.

Cynefin offers five decision-making contexts or "domains"—clear (known as simple until 2014, then obvious until being recently renamed), complicated, complex, chaotic, and confusion—that help managers to identify how they perceive situations and make sense of their own and other people's behaviour. The framework draws on research into systems theory, complexity theory, network theory and learning theories.

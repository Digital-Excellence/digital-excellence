# Wicked Problem

In planning and policy, a wicked problem is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. It refers to *an idea or problem that cannot be fixed, where there is no single solution to the problem*

> The term *'wicked'* denotes **resistance to resolution**, rather than evil. 

Another definition is *"a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point"*. Moreover, because of [[Complexity|complex]] interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems. Due to their [[complexity]], wicked problems are often characterized by organized irresponsibility.

## Origin


The phrase was originally used in social planning. Its modern sense was introduced in 1967 by C. West Churchman in a guest editorial Churchman wrote in the journal Management Science, either repeating his own coinage or responding to a previous use of the term by Horst Rittelâ€”the origin is uncertain. Churchman discussed the moral responsibility of operations research "to inform the manager in what respect our 'solutions' have failed to tame his wicked problems." Rittel and Melvin M. Webber formally described the concept of wicked problems in a 1973 treatise, contrasting "wicked" problems with relatively "tame", soluble problems in mathematics, chess, or puzzle solving.
